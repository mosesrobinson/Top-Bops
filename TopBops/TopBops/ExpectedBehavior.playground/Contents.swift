/*
 
 Expected behavior:
 
 - On launch, the user should see a UITableView showing one album per cell.
 
 - Each cell should display the name of the album, the artist, and the album art (thumbnail image).
 
 - Tapping on a cell should push another view controller onto the navigation stack where
 
 - we see a larger image at the top of the screen and the same information that was shown on the cell,
 
 - plus genre, release date, and copyright info below the image.
 
 - A button should also be included on this second view that when tapped fast app switches to the album page in the itunes store.
 
 - The button should be centered horizontally and pinned 20 points from the bottom of the view and 20 points from the leading and trailing edges of the view.
 
 - Unlike the first one, this “detail” view controller should NOT use a UITableView for layout.
